;; Abstract Abstract: Alacris chief architect Fran√ßois-Ren√© Rideau discusses the operating system's
;; domain specific language for developing distributed apps that can be automatically verified to
;; protect their assets against known attack techniques, and used to specify multi-party protocols
;; to be run on clients and servers as well as smart contracts.

;; Abstract: It is extremely hard to build non-trivial Blockchain Distributed Applications (DApps)
;; that can hope to remain secure when protecting large assets against dedicated attackers.
;; The Alacris Operating System is growing a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to enable development
;; of DApps that can be automatically formally verified to run correctly even when faced with
;; adversarial behavior. More than libraries on a general purpose language, the DSL can enforce
;; global program invariants. More than a smart contract language, the DSL specifies a multiparty
;; protocol, from which all code can be extracted, correctly, that will run on clients and servers
;; as well as in blockchain smart contracts. The DApp compilation strategies can be ported to all
;; blockchains and may address interoperability, scalability and privacy.
