Abstract Abstract: Alacris chief architect Fran√ßois-Ren√© Rideau discusses the operating system's
domain specific language for developing decentralized apps that can be automatically verified to
protect their assets against known attack techniques, and used to specify multi-party protocols
to be run on clients and servers as well as smart contracts.

Abstract: It is extremely hard to build non-trivial Blockchain Decentralized Applications (DApps)
that can hope to remain secure when protecting large assets against dedicated attackers.
The Alacris Operating System is growing a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to enable development
of DApps that can be automatically formally verified to run correctly even when faced with
adversarial behavior. More than libraries on a general purpose language, the DSL can enforce
global program invariants. More than a smart contract language, the DSL specifies a multiparty
protocol, from which all code can be extracted, correctly, that will run on clients and servers
as well as in blockchain smart contracts. The DApp compilation strategies can be ported to all
blockchains and will address interoperability, scalability and privacy.
